## Usage
#### To use this application, we need to change the end point of the API, depending on what the user wants do to. For example, if the user wants to create a new user, the `users` end point is needed `http://localhost:3001/api/users` and the input for user and email in [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

## Test

#### In order to test this  application, we need to have [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) software, clone [Social Network API](https://github.com/SantiBass/the-rain-of-fire-will-refresh-your-social-network-api) code or download the zip file. Once the files are in your [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), open an integrated terminal and run this command line `"nomdemon server".` After the application is running in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), we can test the end points. For example, GET `http://localhost:3001/api/users/` to get all the users or DELETE `http://localhost:5002/api/users/enter-user-id-here`
